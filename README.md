file-editor
===========

File editing program written in AutoIT.  Replaces parts of file with user input.

Takes user through file (named 't.txt' in same folder)
Looks for *A* and *Z* and everything in between, asks user what to replace it with.
Replaces *A* *Z* and everything in between with user input data.

It does this for each instance of *A* - *Z*.

That's it! (for now)
